# Caesar Cipher Implementation

This project implements a Caesar cipher encryption and decryption system. It provides both library functions for programmatic use and a CLI demo for user interaction.

## Features
- **Encryption**: Shift letters in the input message to create a cipher text.
- **Decryption**: Reverse the process to recover the original message.
- **Support for Special Characters**: Non-alphabetical characters remain unchanged.
- **Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests ensure the integrity of the cipher.

## Setup
To set up the project, install the required dependencies:
